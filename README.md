Python implementation of the MTCOV algorithm described in:

- [1] Contisciani M., Power E. & De Bacco C. (2020). *Community detection with node attributes in multilayer networks*,  Scientific Reports **10**, 15736 (2020).  

This is a new generative algorithm that incorporates both the topology of interactions and node attributes to extract overlapping communities in directed and undirected multilayer networks.

## What's included
- `code` : Contains the Python implementation of the MTCOV algorithm, the code for performing the cross-validation procedure and the code for generating synthetic data.
- `data/input` : Contains an example of directed multilayer network, including the adjacency tensor and the design matrix. These are synthetic data.
- `data/output` : Contains some results for testing the code.

## Requirements
The project has been developed using Python 3.7 with the packages contained in _requirements.txt_. It is possible to install the dependencies using pip:
`pip install -r requirements.txt`

## Test
You can run tests to reproduce results contained in `data/output` by running (inside `code` directory):  
`python -m unittest test.py`   
`python -m unittest test_cv.py`   
## Usage
To test the program on the given example file, type:  
`cd code`   
`python main.py`

It will use the sample network contained in `./data/input`. The adjacency tensor _adj.csv_ represents a directed, unweighted network with **N=300** nodes and **L=4** layers. The design matrix _X.csv_ contains the attribute _Metadata_ with **Z=2** modalities used in the analysis. The algorithm runs with **C=2** communities and **gamma=0.5**. 

### Parameters
- **-j** : Input file name of the adjacency tensor, *(default='adj.csv')*.
- **-c** : Input file name of the design matrix, *(default='X.csv')*.
- **-o** : Name of the source of the edge, *(default='source')*.
- **-r** : Name of the target of the edge, *(default='target')*.
- **-x** : Name of the column with node labels, *(default='Name')*.
- **-a** : Name of the attribute to consider in the analysis, *(default='Metadata')*.
- **-C** : Number of communities, *(default=2)*.
- **-g** : Scaling parameter gamma, *(default=0.5)*.
- **-u** : Flag to call the undirected network, *(default=False)*.
- **-d** : Flag to force a dense transformation of the adjacency tensor, *(default=False)*.
- **-F** : Flag to choose the convergence procedure, *(default='log')*. If 'log' the convergence is based on the loglikelihood values; 
            if 'deltas' the convergence is based on the differences in the parameters values. The latter is suggested 
            when the dataset is big (N > 1000 ca.).
- **-z** : Seed for random real numbers. 
- **-e** : Error for the initialization of W, *(default=0.1)*.
- **-i** : Number of iterations with different random initialization; the final parameters will be the one corresponding to the realization leading to the max likelihood, *(default=1)*.
- **-t** : Tolerance parameter for convergence, *(default=0.0001)*.
- **-y** : Decision variable for convergence, *(default=10)*.
- **-m** : Maximum number of EM steps before aborting, *(default=500)*.
- **-E** : Output file suffix, *(default='.dat')*.
- **-I** : Path of the input folder, *(default='../data/input/')*.
- **-O** : Path of the output folder, *(default='../data/output/')*.
- **-A** : Flag to call the assortative network, *(default=False)*.

## Input format
The multilayer network should be stored in a CSV file. An example of row is

`node1 node2 0 0 1`

where the first and second columns are the _source_ and _target_ nodes of the edge, respectively; l+2 column tells if there is that edge in the l-th layer and the weight. In this example the edge node1 --> node2 exists in layer 3 with weight 1, but not in layer 1 and 2.

Note: if the network is undirected, you only need to input each edge once. You then need to specify to the algorithm that you are considering the undirected case by giving as a command line input parameter **-u=True**. 

The design matrix should be stored in a CSV file, where one column (_Name_) indicates the node labels. 

## Output
The MTCOV returns a compressed file inside the `data/output/test` folder. To load and print the out-going membership matrix:

`theta = np.load('theta_test_GT.npz')`.      
`print(theta['u'])`

*theta* contains the two NxC membership matrices **U** *('u')* and **V** *('v')*, the LxCxC affinity tensor **W** *('w')*, the CxZ matrix **beta** *('beta')*, the total number of iterations *('max_it')*, the nodes of the network *('nodes')*, the value of the maximum likelihood *('maxL')* and the number of realizations *('N_real')*.
