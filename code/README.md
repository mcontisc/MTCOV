## Files
- `main.py` : General version of the algorithm. It performs overlapping community detection in multilayer directed and undirected networks by combining together the topology of interactions and node attributes.
- `MTCOV.py` : Contains the class definition of a Multilayer network with all the member functions required.
- `tools.py` : Contains non-class functions for handling the data.
- `main_cv_single_real.py` : Code for performing a cross-validation procedure, in order to estimate the hyperparameters **C** and **gamma**. It runs with a given C and gamma and returns a file summarizing the results over all folds. The output file contains the value of the log-likelihood, the AUC of the link prediction and the accuracy of the attribute prediction, both in the train and in test sets.
- `run_cv.sh` : Code for running the cross-validation procedure with a given range of C and gamma values.
- `cv_functions.py` : Contains functions for performing the K-fold cross-validation procedure.
- `analysis_cross_validation.ipynb` : Jupyter Notebook for analysing the results of the cross-validation.
- `generate_data.py` : Code for generating the synthetic data used in the analysis reported in the paper. It generates multilayer synthetic directed networks with different kinds of structure in the various layers. The network structure is generated by using a stochastic block model, and the attributes are generated by matching them with planted communities in different ratios. The code can be generalized to accomodate more than 2 communities.
- `test.py` : Code for testing the main algorithm.
- `test_cv.py` : Code for testing the cross-validation procedure.


## Usage
To test the program on the given example file, type

`python main.py`

It will use the sample network contained in `./data/input`. The adjacency tensor _adj.csv_ represents a directed, unweighted network with **N=300** nodes and **L=4** layers. The design matrix _X.csv_ contains the attribute _Metadata_ with **Z=2** modalities used in the analysis. The algorithm runs with **C=2** communities and **gamma=0.5**. 

### Parameters
- **-j** : Input file name of the adjacency tensor, *(default='adj.csv')*.
- **-c** : Input file name of the design matrix, *(default='X.csv')*.
- **-o** : Name of the source of the edge, *(default='source')*.
- **-r** : Name of the target of the edge, *(default='target')*.
- **-a** : Name of the attribute to consider in the analysis, *(default='Metadata')*.
- **-I** : Name of the column with node labels, *(default='Name')*.
- **-C** : Number of communities, *(default=2)*.
- **-g** : Scaling parameter gamma, *(default=0.5)*.
- **-u** : Flag to call the undirected network, *(default=False)*.
- **-d** : Flag to force a dense transformation of the adjacency tensor, *(default=False)*.
- **-z** : Seed for random real numbers, *(default=107261)*.
- **-e** : Error for the initialization of W, *(default=0.1)*.
- **-i** : Number of iterations with different random initialization; the final parameters will be the one corresponding to the realization leading to the max likelihood, *(default=1)*.
- **-t** : Tolerance parameter for convergence, *(default=0.1)*.
- **-y** : Decision variable for convergence, *(default=10)*.
- **-m** : Maximum number of EM steps before aborting, *(default=500)*.
- **-E** : Output file suffix, *(default='.dat')*.

## Input format
The multilayer network should be stored in a CSV file. An example of row is

`node1 node2 0 0 1`

where the first and second columns are the _source_ and _target_ nodes of the edge, respectively; l+2 column tells if there is that edge in the l-th layer and the weight. In this example the edge node1 --> node2 exists in layer 3 with weight 1, but not in layer 1 and 2.

Note: if the network is undirected, you only need to input each edge once. You then need to specify to the algorithm that you are considering the undirected case by giving as a command line input parameter **-u=True**. 

The design matrix should be stored in a CSV file, where one column (_Name_) indicates the node labels. 

## Output
The MTCOV returns four files inside the `data/output` folder: the two NxC membership matrices **U** and **V**, the CxCxL affinity tensor **W** and the CxZ matrix **beta**. 

The first line outputs the maximum log-likelihood (*Max Likelihood*) among the different iterations performed with different random initialization (*NReal*) and the value of the *gamma* scaling parameter.

For the membership files, the subsequent lines contain C+1 columns: the first one is the node label, the following ones are the membership probabilities.

For the affinity tensor file, the subsequent lines start with the number of the layer and then the affinity matrix for that layer.

For the beta file, the subsequent line contains the names of the modalities of the categorical attribute. Then, the following lines contain Z columns with the probabilities indicating the correlation between communities and attributes.
